## 🧠 Overview

The **Payment Integration System** is a complete **microservices-based solution** designed to handle secure payment processing.  
It includes request validation, digital signing, provider communication, and mock payment gateway simulation using modern **Spring Boot practices**.

Each service operates independently and communicates via REST APIs — ensuring scalability, security, and modularity.
